some oop knowledge:
1. Encapsulation is when some things are private and some things public
2. Abstraction is when only a few surface level things are public and the rest under the hood is private
3. Inheritance is when you create a sub-class that has all the attributes of the parent class but with
    it's own additional attributes
4. Polymorphism happens when you add more attributes or functions to the constructors and methods of a
    parent-class in a sub-class
